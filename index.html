      <h1>The first computer “bug” was an actual real-life bug 🪲</h1>
      <p>
        In the programming world, a bug is an error that causes a program to
        crash or behave in strange ways. First coined by Thomas Edison in 1878
        (to refer to technical errors of the period), the term “bug” would
        eventually find mainstream use in modern computing. However, it was in
        1947 that the first case of a computer bug was recorded. Grace Hopper,
        an admiral in the US Navy, was working on a Mark II computer when she
        discovered a moth had become stuck in the relay, thus causing it to
        malfunction. Once the moth was removed, she wrote in her journal “first
        actual case of bug being found” – and the rest is history.
